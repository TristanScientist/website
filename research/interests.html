    Rulers of the Earth had many key transitions in their path to taking over the world. Plants, animals, and fungi all
    have these things in common. They rule the world. They all love low volume funk music. And they are multicellular
    (mostly). These behemoths of lifeforms pack cell specialization, where labor is divided and given to cells dedicated
    to performing specific tasks. These are exemplified by muscle cells in the animals, whose whole morphology developed
    to “pull on the body and move it a certain direction.” Multicellularity was a game changer in a world dominated by
    microbes like bacteria and protists. When single celled protists started living in colonies, a form of society
    emerged. Just like human society, when they started out, multicellulars weren't as complex as they are today.
    Remnants of ancient human societies live on today and they still carry on their traditions, but because of the
    development to the modern world, they have changed. Likewise, remnants of ancient protist societies still live on
    today and we can study them to learn more about how the features of multicellularity evolved. This is akin to
    looking at the traditions of modern Māori communities in order to understand their Polynesian ancestors. But sadly,
    many intermediates between ancient and new societies have gone extinct. We can only learn with what we have. For
    studying the evolution of animals, we have <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choanoflagellate

    among other model
    organisms. If you're interested in this topic, I've linked research papers below for you especially.

    Why am I so interested in multicellularity? It contains many nuggets of interesting developments in living systems.
    Multicellularity has implications. You become a living environment for others to live on and in. You can evolve
    specialized structures that aren't limited to micrometer scales. You can develop strong extracellular materials that
    prevent drying out. You can rule the land or sky. The road to intelligence requires multicellularity as a key
    transition. One of the things I pursue is a new biology. And that can be given in two ways: synthetic life or
    undiscovered life. For those wanting to create or find intelligent life, multicellularity is something you must
    generate or look for. It requires living systems to be social with each other to accomplish a greater task.
    </br></br>
    The border between unicellularity and multicellularity is a rough one. It brings philosophical problems not debated
    in the scientific method. Are we just colonies of clonal cells, each striving to survive but limited by the whole
    colony? Cancer is an interesting case study where cells mutate and begin to act on their own, breaking free of
    programed societal restrictions. Its survival takes over to the detriment of the colony. But we must learn how
    multicellulars evolve to understand what can be used to connect living systems. How may we mimic these requirements
    in unicellulars to convince them to become more social? Fast artificial evolution to multicellularity? There are
    many things to look at. As I said before, multicellularity has great implications.
