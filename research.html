  Finding and characterizing new protist species is insightful for biology yet it is often ignored. As such, the number
  of predicted protist species far outweigh those that are characterized, primarily because it is difficult to capture
  and culture free-living cells. <b>I am  working on a system to make capturing and culturing novel protists
  easier.</b></br></br>

  If you don’t know what protists are, you are missing out. Seriously. I am designing a database for beginners at
  <A href="https://www.protist.info" target="_blank">protist.info</A>. Please do yourself a favor and learn about life far more
  interesting and diverse than plants, fungi, and
  animals combined. View the figure below and look up some
  the groups:</br></br>

  Protists are microbial eukaryotes. Any eukaryote that is not a plant, animal, or fungus. Far more life exist than what you normally see. The first living cells were
  relatively simplistic. A small group of these cells evolved into the eukaryotic lineage, single cells that are huge
  and tend to organize complex processes into specialized compartments. Eukaryotic cells are also known for eating
  smaller living cells, but instead of killing them, they enslave them. Some single celled protists eventually evolved
  into giant multicellular organisms you know as plants and <A HREF="./research/papers/10.1038@nrg.2017.21.pdf" target="_blank">animals</A>.</br></br>

  In recent years microbes have received much deserved attention. This revealed the extreme diversity of bacteria and
  their role both in the environment and inside other organisms. Protists seemed to gather less attention and it is
  surprising the lack of researchers in the protistology, as it is a field rich in the prospect of discovery. I believe
  this stems largely from the lack of proper education about eukaryotes. In biology, most classes are mammal-centric, as
  this is what medical research focuses on. But protists play major roles in aquatic and terrestrial environments as
  well as the human microbiome. They range from parasitic and commensal relationships to free-living drivers of nutrient
  cycles and stabilizers of the biosphere. Protists are the most understudied yet most phylogenetically diverse
  eukaryotic life on the planet.

  A major threat to increasing the resolution of life's history is extinction; it saddens me to think what is forever
  lost to our knowledge. This risk is higher with invertebrates and microbes, which usually don’t leave a footprint to
  study. With <A HREF="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09678" target="_blank">extinction events rapidly accelerating</A>, it harrows me to think that there is undiscovered life out
  there holding interesting developments for biologists everywhere. Out of fear for losing evidence, I prioritize
  discovery, characterization, and invention of novel model organisms to be used for experimentation.
