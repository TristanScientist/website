  My interests are rooted in the evolutionary history of life. Thanks to its diversity and uncertainty, it is easy to
  generate a near infinite amount of questions in this area. Out of necessity, I’ve developed a few quirks and
  principles to follow before constructing a project:</br></br>

  The study of the natural world is intrinsically interdisciplinary. Whether it is the findings of my research or the
  methodologies used, I am open to working in or with multiple fields. Biologists observe living organisms, or at least
  their remains, to understand life and its history. To do so, model organisms are developed, fossils are carefully
  analyzed, genetic information is rigorously processed, and people discover new life in the field. A major threat to
  increasing the resolution of life's history is extinction; it saddens me to think what is forever lost to our
  knowledge. This risk is higher with invertebrates and microbes, which usually don’t leave a footprint to study. With
  extinction events rapidly accelerating<A HREF="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/5/e1400253"
    target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></A>, it harrows me to think that there is undiscovered life out there holding
  interesting developments for biologists everywhere. Out of fear for losing evidence, I prioritize discovery,
  characterization, and invention of novel model organisms to be used for experimentation.</br></br>

  Now is the part where I ramble about more quirks in my research personality. I'm also curious about the
  circumstantiality of life. Does all novel life follow the same milestones of development, such as multicellularity or
  endosymbiosis? Or is it a series of mishaps, like chromosomal duplication or a tornado moving you to another pond?
  Periodically I'm interested in exploring what we think is foundational knowledge. This coincides with a desire
  to reproduce results from keystone publications in the field. Lastly, I tend to avoid exploring life’s history through
  the lens of human evolution, as this creates what is called a 'hidden biology' in other creatures.<A
    HREF="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.03.003" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></A></br></br>

  There is an increasing need for field researchers in biology. Specifically, for the discovery and development of new
  microbial eukaryote model organisms (protists).<A HREF="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jeu.12095"
    target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></A> Finding and characterizing new protist species is insightful for
  biology yet it is often ignored. As such, the number of predicted species of protists far outweighs how many are
  characterized. Primarily because it is difficult to capture and culture free-living cells. This is the problem I'm
  interested in. How can you enhance the discovery process? As part of an undergraduate educational initiative, I
  am hunting holozoan protists
  for research in the evolution of animal multicellularity. This was to give other undergraduates
  more experience in field research and molecular work. More information on this project can be found below.
