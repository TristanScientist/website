        Ah so you've come for a holistic protist education, eh?</br>
        You want to truly understand life? The science of biology? Its complexity, beauty, and history?</br>
        I'll give you what you want. The story of protists. You're part of this story and so are plants and fungi.
        You will be educated on Unicellular Eukaryotes in an unconventional way. We'll talk about all the messy and
        cool topics. Protistory brings ideas of science,
        history, microscopy, art, and Earth models all in one interdisciplinary space. Live interviews with experts.
        Hunting microbes in the wild. Sex education. Poetry and artworks. Real Research. Actual living things. </br>This
        project is currently being developed. If you would like to be notified about its release, please join the
