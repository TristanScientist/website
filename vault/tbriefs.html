                    Eukaryotic life is unique and circumstantial. It is not a step to take to become
                    multicellular, intelligent, or successful. It is a unique story of life on Earth. It is most likely
                    that
                    any other life in the universe has not developed the same way we have. If other life exists, then
                    they
                    have their own story. It was circumstantial that Eukaryotic life evolved the ability to symbiose and
                    evolve new things such as multicellular specializations, fast locomotion, better energy production,
                    etc. We
                    should not be so ignorant to think that other life in the universe, evolved independently, has the
                    same composition and is taking the same steps life on Earth took to evolve. The chance for new life
                    to
                    evolve is extremely low. The chance for evolved life to become like us is even lower. Evolution
                    is a unique journey full in circumstances of death and survival depending on the environment. And no
                    environment is exactly the same to another. Additionally the point of Eukaryotic life is important.
                    Its ability to combine with other lifeforms is extraordinarily unique and allowed the generation of
                    gigantic living environments capable of holding another level of life. Such is the case of complex motile multicellularity.
