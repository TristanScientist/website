                    Eukaryotic life is unique and circumstantial. It is not a step to take to become
                    multicellular, intelligent, or successful. It is a unique story of life on Earth. It is most likely
                    that
                    any other life in the universe has not developed the same way we have. If other life exists, then
                    they
                    have their own story. </br></br>
                    
                    It was circumstantial that Eukaryotic life evolved the ability to symbiose and
                    evolve new things such as multicellular specializations, fast locomotion, better energy production,
                    etc. We
                    should not be so ignorant to think that other life in the universe, evolved independently, has the
                    same composition and is taking the same steps life on Earth took to evolve. The chance for new life
                    to
                    evolve is extremely low. The chance for evolved life to become like us is even lower. Evolution
                    is a unique journey full in circumstances of death, survival, and intermingling depending on the
                    environment. And no
                    environment is exactly the same to another. 
                    
                </br></br>Additionally the point of Eukaryotic life is important.
                    Its ability to combine with other lifeforms is extraordinarily unique and allowed the generation of
                    gigantic living environments capable of holding another level of life. Such is the case of complex
                    motile multicellularity.</br></br>

                        Imagine you are a sentient sponge. A unique and amazing organism full of mystery and
                        evolutionary wonder. Curious humans harvest you from the ocean. Some poke at you and eventually
                        use complex biological research methods to figure you out. They declare you a primitive animal.
                    </br></br>
                        “That’s rude” you say, “I’m not primitive! I’m a god damn modern masterpiece.”
                    </br></br>
                        The humans scoff. “You’ve barely reached multicellularity and have little to no specialization.
                        Of course you are primitive.”, “You don’t even have a nervous system, or muscles, or adaptive
                        immunity, or symmetry!”
                    </br></br>
                        “You don’t even know me! You’re only pointing out what I don’t have.”
                    </br></br>
                        What the humans didn’t know is that the sponge held many interesting and new developments since
                        they diverged from the last common ancestor. New features unique to the spongy kingdom. Funny
                        things those humans. They always look for primitive versions of themselves that they ignore
                        unique developments in modern life. Plotting a path along the tree of life that perfectly fits
                        human evolution.
                    </br></br>
                        How did our brain evolve? Let us look at the descending path of nervous systems from ape to
                        mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, lamprey, amphioxus, etc. While these guys may hold remnants
                        of the primitive brain, it is easy to forget that these are all modern organisms. They may have
                        evolved new features that we ignore because we are looking for genes and physiology homologous
                        to humans.
                    </br></br>
                        Keep in mind: Biologists use MODEL organisms. Not the original ancestor. The further down the
                        tree of life we go, the more chance there are new and unique features. But if we are only
                        looking for homology, we will overlook those features. This the idea of hidden biology. Created
                        usually by a bilaterian, vertebrate, or human centric view of biological research. Here is a
                        neat visual:
