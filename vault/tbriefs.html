                <font color=FECA92>
                    •	[7/19/19] A good lecture has 3 points; structure around them.</br>
                    •	[9/21/19] Do not forget simplistic and explanatory mindsets.</br>
                    •	[11/10/19] Textbooks hide many unknowns giving the façade that we know everything.</br>
                    •	[11/10/19] The more you think about and delve into a topic, the more interested you become.</br>
                    •	[11/14/19] Part of teaching is to source from conceptual, high arching, and interdisciplinary material.</br>
                    •	[12/4/19] Do not make students compete for grades. Make them compete for love.</br>
                    •	[~1/11/20] In teaching, listing objectives of cyclic processes is not effective. Holistically explain the process, not the steps.</br>
                    •	[1/15/20] I’m infuriated from lazy teaching and blatant ignoration of students’ interests. Craft lectures. Explain the whys and hows underneath things. Tell it how it really is.</br>
                    •	[1/21/20] Often people don’t understand fundamental concepts (yet are at an advanced level); when educating a crowd, you must start with a simplified primer to a more complex idea. Never assume they know what you do.</br>
                    •	[1/24/20] Before teaching conceptually, stress the reality of putting in work to understand and practice.</br>
                    •	[1/27/20] As a form of testing; Oral exam by randomly selected topics. Related to life and class topics.</br>
                    •	[1/27/20] Teaching where information came from can be enlightening. It isn’t what it seems.</br>
                    •	[1/27/20] Making a class progressively more difficult does not increase learning. It inhibits it.</br>
                    •	[1/27/20] A scientific presentation to non-experts should be broad and have some type of lesson, so that it may be useful to the audience. Presentations should be tailored to the audience based on the goal of benefiting them.</br>
                    •	[1/30/20] A good professor/expert in their field will tell you what isn’t known and what is definitely known.</br>
                    •	[~1/31/20] It unlocks the whole world for you if you learn to appreciate everything.</br>
                    •	[~2/5/20] It’s good to admit lack of knowledge but also know you can yield results w/o it.</br>
                    •	[~2/6/20] Professor interaction in student queries; let them know incorrect thoughts are not bad.</br>
                    •	[2/10/20] To become good at something be observant and analyze those who are great at it. Absorb their wisdom without their knowing.</br>
                    •	[2/12/20] A professor in anything, especially biology, must be fluid, dynamic, adaptable, and humble in multiple ways.</br>
                    •	[2/12/20] If teaching zoology, one must begin explaining principles of its origin and evolution. In a genomic, taxonomic, morphological, and social sense. Explain the relations.</br>
                    •	[2/19/20] Bring props to presentation/lecture, like a sequencer. </br>
                    •	[~/3/4/20] Testing method section: creativity, do whatever you want (draw, write, etc.).</br>
                    •	[3/22/20] A show about the frontiers of knowledge. What we don’t know.</br>
                    •	[4/10/20] Start with a class opener. Groups. Discuss what life is. Do not go over syllabus, their adults.</br>
                    •	[4/14/20] Concepts first, people later. To make one memorize minor things before knowing the concept of what’s going on is idiotic. First and most important: make it interesting.</br>
                    •	[4/14/20] Make a class a choose your own adventure by allowing creativity and multiple paths to pursue the same foundation the class is built off.</br>
                    •	[5/5/20] How can you make examination fun? Depends on the student.</br>
                    •	[8/25/20] Is it better to have a perfect lecture w/ anticipated answers, or with holes for questions? This is the idea of question traps.</br>
                    •	[9/12/20] Biology is complex to teach and jargon-rich because it is full of chemicals and physical modifications deserving of names.</br>
                    •	[9/13/20] Examination system: Maximum points: Base exam then conceptual alternate pathways.</br>
                    •	[9/22/20] Hand out first exam on the first day of class to explain how you do assessments. Transparency is key to happy students.</br>
                    •	[9/23/20] Always implement short pauses or “mistakeful” breaks during a presentation or lecture. Controlled moments of chaos increase attentiveness.</br>
                    •	[9/23/20] Presentations are a performance, and you are responsible for audience understanding.</br>
                    •	[10/31/20] Presenting methodologies is boring. No numbers. No big words. Show background and findings only. (Unless you are presenting to your colleagues of course.)</br>
                    •	[10/31/20] If you include a graph or phrase most people won’t understand, don’t add it. Unless you are willing to spend a good chunk of time covering it; it must be important.</br>
                    •	[11/17/20] How does angiogenesis even work? Some things in life we do not describe interesting enough.</br>
                    •	[11/18/20] Lectures should be perfectly scripted with controlled moments of chaos.</br>
                    •	[12/1/20] Many professors neglect a holistic view of time in biological processes.</br>
                    •	[12/2/20] If a prof. has nothing more to offer than textbook knowledge, then they are useless.</br> 
                    •	[12/10/20] A professor must adapt their teaching to address the weakest foundational levels of the student most at risk of getting lost with the material. </br>
                    •	[1/1/21] It’s inherent to a course to focus on what we know, but this does not train a scientist.</br>
                    •	[1/22/21] It can be tempting to push ideas for being a good student, but don’t let it stop you from being a good professor. Lecturer versus advice coach dilemma.</br>
                    •	[1/22/21] Presentations should be crafted as a narrative, beginning to end is a journey.</br>
                    •	[1/22/21] A lecturer should go out of their way and innovate demonstrations of concepts live.</br>
                    •	[2/2/21] A professor should provide greater context to and insight behind situations/concepts described.</br>
                    •	[2/4/21] Implement short repetitive concepts in a class; they will stick forever in the minds of students. Plants wise seeds through repeating phrases. They do not have to understand them completely yet.</br>
                    •	[3/9/21] If you do not craft your lectures, your teaching is disingenuous.</br>
                    •	[~3/29/21] The wiser understand patterns and provide them for the inexperienced.</br>
                    •	[~3/30/21] A lecture should include life lessons, advice, and wisdom.</br>
                    •	[~3/30/21] A lecturer should develop personal antics. (Related to 2/4)</br>
                    •	[4/4/21] Have students design their own protein (euk and prok). Submit gene sequences.</br>
                    •	[4/5/21] There is no template on how to teach and persuade in every subject.</br>
                    •	[4/6/21] Instead of opening the floor to questions, pick individuals strategically to answer.</br>
                    •	[4/6/21] Science professors should have a “what are we going to learn this semester and why” overview.</br>
                    •	[4/16/21] Most professors inherent their teaching and assessment methods with out a clue of their purpose.</br>
                    •	[unknown] The end stages of a class should not introduce new big topics, but connect all others covered.</br>
                    •	[unknown] Students will most likely not be active unless the professor builds a world engaging them.</br>
                    •	[unknown] Not every seminar in science should be a research presentation. Talk philosophy and spread bigger ideas.</br>
                    •	[5/3/21] Never assume anyone’s level of knowledge. Educators beware.</br>
                    •	[5/6/21] Do not force the memorization of things you can’t remember yourself.</br>
                    •	[5/6/21] Assessments have never been for students. Their purpose lacks individual tailored education.</br>
                    •	[5/6/21] If you do not understand something that’s ok. Exposure and repetition make an expert.</br>
                    •	[5/8/21] Force wisdom onto others without their asking.</br>
                    •	[5/8/21] Names are an illusion/façade. Describe things the way they are without naming first.</br>
                    •	[~5/8/21] Professors tend to start in media res. Start with beginnings that build foundations.</br>
                    •	[5/12/21] In teaching, it is easy to make things hard, but it is hard (on the teacher) to make things easy to learn.</br>
                    •	[5/30/21] Explain the methods of acquiring knowledge and why “modern” is superior.</br>

                    Eukaryotic life is unique and circumstantial. It is not a step to take to become
                    multicellular, intelligent, or successful. It is a unique story of life on Earth. It is most likely
                    that
                    any other life in the universe has not developed the same way we have. If other life exists, then
                    they
                    have their own story. </br></br>

                    It was circumstantial that Eukaryotic life evolved the ability to symbiose and
                    evolve new things such as multicellular specializations, fast locomotion, better energy production,
                    etc. We
                    should not be so ignorant to think that other life in the universe, evolved independently, has the
                    same composition and is taking the same steps life on Earth took to evolve. The chance for new life
                    to
                    evolve is extremely low. The chance for evolved life to become like us is even lower. Evolution
                    is a unique journey full in circumstances of death, survival, and intermingling depending on the
                    environment. And no
                    environment is exactly the same to another.

                    </br></br>Additionally the point of Eukaryotic life is important.
                    Its ability to combine with other lifeforms is extraordinarily unique and allowed the generation of
                    gigantic living environments capable of holding another level of life. Such is the case of complex
                    motile multicellularity.</br></br>

                        Imagine you are a sentient sponge. A unique and amazing organism full of mystery and
                        evolutionary wonder. Curious humans harvest you from the ocean. Some poke at you and eventually
                        use complex biological research methods to figure you out. They declare you a primitive animal.
                        </br></br>
                        “That’s rude” you say, “I’m not primitive! I’m a god damn modern masterpiece.”
                        </br></br>
                        The humans scoff. “You’ve barely reached multicellularity and have little to no specialization.
                        Of course you are primitive.”, “You don’t even have a nervous system, or muscles, or adaptive
                        immunity, or symmetry!”
                        </br></br>
                        “You don’t even know me! You’re only pointing out what I don’t have.”
                        </br></br>
                        What the humans didn’t know is that the sponge held many interesting and new developments since
                        they diverged from the last common ancestor. New features unique to the spongy kingdom. Funny
                        things those humans. They always look for primitive versions of themselves that they ignore
                        unique developments in modern life. Plotting a path along the tree of life that perfectly fits
                        human evolution.
                        </br></br>
                        How did our brain evolve? Let us look at the descending path of nervous systems from ape to
                        mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, lamprey, amphioxus, etc. While these guys may hold remnants
                        of the primitive brain, it is easy to forget that these are all modern organisms. They may have
                        evolved new features that we ignore because we are looking for genes and physiology homologous
                        to humans.
                        </br></br>
                        Keep in mind: Biologists use MODEL organisms. Not the original ancestor. The further down the
                        tree of life we go, the more chance there are new and unique features. But if we are only
                        looking for homology, we will overlook those features. This is the idea of hidden biology, which is usually created 
                        by a bilaterian, vertebrate, or human centric view of biological research. Here is a
                        neat visual:

                                    Let’s assume the physicalist’s worldview, as this is where age is defined.
                                    </br></br>
                                    Most would say your mom is older than you right? However, you <i>are</i> your mom
                                    and father in a physical sense. A lineage of their cells combined. If you trace the
                                    physical connections at a cellular level, you will find that all life is connected
                                    in a space-time sense. Four dimensions. Consider time and your object as one lovely
                                    space worm. Here I claim that we are the same age. Since I’m the owner of this
                                    website I get to set the rules on how age is defined and how we use it. You must
                                    also consider that my views of Life and multicellularity are unconventional.
                                    </br></br>
                                    It’s odd but I consider all of Life on Earth as one organism. A four-dimensional
                                    organism. I am one prong of that organism; like a leaf is to a whole tree. The
                                    nature of life is that it physically changes with respect to time. It is also
                                    cellular based. It seems necessary to keep a self-replicating mechanism
                                    compartmentalized or the machinery will float away from each other.

                                    Birth to death is practically and legally useful to define age. Realistically it is
                                    problematic. Would we start at conception? When two sex cells meet? When you exit
                                    the womb? Multicellularity has clouded judgement of ‘being’ a living thing for all
                                    human history. Physically you were two separate sex cells. The egg technically split
                                    at a separate time the sperm was. Those created by germ cell lineages from your
                                    mother and father, whose lineages can be further traced back to more parental germ
                                    cells. In practical terms, we divide ourselves in separate human body chunks of
                                    time. That is extremely useful for our mental existence. But just because you are
                                    separate from your parents now, does not mean you aren’t physically connected.

                                    Just to further drive my point, let’s try to define the age of a single-celled
                                    organism. A paramecium. Do we begin as soon as the sister cell splits and to when it
                                    dies? Or when the DNA is replicated? Is the new DNA part of the new organism?
                                    Sometimes it is jumbled up. A bit of new and old together in a new and old
                                    compartment. Technically it has always been living before its DNA was replicated and
                                    before it splits from its sister. When it ‘dies’, it probably already replicated
                                    into a hundred more cells. The nature and machinery of Life persists by making more
                                    of itself. Thus, more bodies (or compartments) are made that further replicate
                                    themselves. Are they separate beings because they are not physically connected at
                                    one slice of time?<b><i> The border between coming into existence and not existing is
                                        arbitrary when you look between the beginning and end of all Life.</b></i>

                                    I define age as the span of time a four-dimensional object begins and ceases to
                                    exist. If Life is our object, then we must consider its beginning and its future
                                    demise. I claim we are all one 4D organism. Physically derived lineages,
                                    theoretically rooting back to a common ancestor. Connected in space and time through
                                    the lineage and nature of persisting replicative compartments that at the time of
                                    replication, can physically change. All I did was redefine what age refers to.
                                    Rather than the age of one prong of the 4D organism, I refer to the whole. It makes
                                    sense in a weird way that everything living at this moment is the same age. Say
                                    something goes extinct. The prong of that something stops its age. But the living 4D
                                    organism remains the same age, like a tree losing a branch. The tree is still alive.

                                    In a non-physicalist framework, we can’t truly know the age of ourselves. The
                                    philosophy here is extensive and I don’t know it. Is our state of being separate
                                    from the irrelevant vessels of our cell-based bodies? A biologist harrows at the
                                    thought of that. The idea of an individual mind and its existence as “being.” We
                                    can’t know the age. As it is probably outside of time like God. Ageless is the state
                                    of being.
